				PUBG Mobile is without doubt one of the most popular mobile video games in the world and it was hugely popular in India too until the mobile game was banned by the Indian government in September. The Indian government had banned the game under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act saying that PUBG Mobile app was engaged in activities that are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of the country. 
	
				It is to be noted that India is not the only country that banned PUBG Mobile as the multiplayer mobile game was banned in several countries due to various reasons. However, PUBG Mobile is now unbanned in several countries and now PUBG Corporation is making efforts to relaunch the mobile game to India.

				PUBG was recently unbanned in China, Pakistan, Korea and Nepal. 
	
				In India, PUBG Corporation has snapped ties with Tencent Games in order to launch PUBG Mobile India. The company has also registered a subsidiary in India and has announced to invest USD 100 million in India. PUBG Corporation, however, is still waiting for permission from the Centre to launch PUBG Mobile India.</p>
